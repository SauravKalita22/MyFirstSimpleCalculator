# A SIMPLE CALCULATOR 
This is a simple calculator that is developed as my first project using
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

I used my own logic while building so it might not be that efficient as the ones found on the internet.
Therefore, I would be happy if you all can contribute and make this simple calculator a better one in terms of user interaction.
Everyone is welcome to contribute to this simple project.
Thank You
